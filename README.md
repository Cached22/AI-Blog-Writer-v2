1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `app.py` to start the Flask server.
5. Access the web app through your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Metadata & Postprocessing**: Edit metadata and finalize your blog posts for publishing.

## API Documentation

The app provides several endpoints for interacting with the backend services:

- `/generate_blog` - POST: Accepts keywords and returns generated blog content.
- `/perform_research` - POST: Takes a query and returns summarized research data.
- `/analyze_seo` - POST: Receives blog content or URL and returns SEO analysis.
- `/update_metadata` - POST: Updates and returns blog metadata based on content.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed request and response formats.

## Developer Guide

The app is structured around Flask routes that serve the frontend and call Python scripts from the `lib` folder for various functionalities. Each script is responsible for a specific task and can be easily updated or replaced as needed.

For example, `keywords_to_blog.py` is used to generate blog content from keywords:

```python
from keywords_to_blog import generate_blog_from_keywords

# Sample usage within a Flask route
@app.route('/generate_blog', methods=['POST'])
def generate_blog():
    keywords = request.json['keywords']
    blog_content = generate_blog_from_keywords(keywords)
    return jsonify(blog_content)
```

Ensure all scripts are updated to work with Python 3.10 and above.

## Testing

The app includes a test suite located in the `tests` directory. Run the tests using the PyTest framework to ensure all components are functioning correctly.

## Security and Performance

- User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- Authentication and access control are implemented for sensitive operations.
- Performance bottlenecks are identified and optimized.

## Error Handling

The app features robust error handling, providing clear feedback to the user and logging errors for developer review.
